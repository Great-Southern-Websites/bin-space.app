"""Generate the per-council bin day pages under content/bin-day/.

Each page is a static shell: the council, its provenance and its population are
baked in at generation time, and the collection day itself is looked up in the
browser against api.bin-space.app. Nothing about a date is written into the
HTML, so a generated page cannot go stale the way a printed calendar does - and
it works for the zone-keyed councils too, where a suburb has no single answer.

Run it again whenever coverage changes:

    python3 tools/generate-bin-day-pages.py

It rewrites content/bin-day/ and public/sitemap.xml, and commits are expected -
the output is checked in so the build has no network dependency and so a
coverage change is visible in review rather than appearing silently at deploy.
